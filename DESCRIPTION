Description: Provides tools to fit regression models when the outcome follows a 
  Compound Poisson-Normal (CPN) distribution. The model assumes a 
  Poisson-distributed count of latent normal variables whose sum is observed, 
  allowing joint modeling of zero inflation and continuous positive values. 
  Includes methods for estimation, inference, simulation, and model diagnostics.
