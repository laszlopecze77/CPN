\title{Summary Method for Compound Poisson-Normal Regression Models}
\usage{
\method{summary}{cpn}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"cpn"} returned by the \code{\link{cpn}} function.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data frame with estimated coefficients, standard errors,
z-values, and p-values.
}
\description{
Provides a detailed summary of a fitted \code{cpn} model, including estimated
coefficients, standard errors, z-values, p-values, deviance residuals, and
model fit statistics (AIC, deviance).
}
\details{
This method extracts parameter estimates from a fitted Compound Poisson-Normal regression
model and computes inferential statistics (z-scores and p-values) for the Poisson regression
coefficients. It also reports the estimated parameters for the normal component (\code{mu} and \code{sigma}),
a summary of deviance residuals, and fit statistics such as null and residual deviance and the AIC.
