\title{Extract Residuals from a Compound Poisson-Normal (CPN) Model}
\usage{
\method{residuals}{cpn}(object, type = c("deviance", "raw"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"cpn"}, typically produced by a CPN model fitting function.}

\item{type}{Character string indicating the type of residuals to return.
Choices are \code{"deviance"} (default) or \code{"raw"}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of residuals. Returns deviance residuals if \code{type = "deviance"},
or raw residuals (observed - fitted) if \code{type = "raw"}.
}
\description{
This method extracts residuals from a fitted model object of class \code{"cpn"}.
Supports both raw and deviance residuals.
